## About Me
Hello! I'm August from Vilnius, Lithuania ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¹ and I'm a junior front-end developer!

## My Journey into Coding
I began my coding journey in summer 2023 when I decided to make a significant career change. Back then I didn't feel satisfied with where I was at that point in my life and I knew that something had to change. So I decided to leave my home in London, and move back to Lithuania (talk about major life decisions!). I've received a scholarship from Code Academy in Vilnius and started my coding journey in October. For the next three months I explored JAVA, Python, PHP, SEO, Front-End and even UX Design. But the most exiting path was front-end development. So since January 2024, I delved deeper and learned all of the exiting aspects of front-end development.
